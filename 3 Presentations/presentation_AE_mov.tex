\section[slide=false]{Nuclear Safeguards}

\begin{slide}{Safeguards}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Safeguards is a very broad area ranging from nuclear
        physics to political regulations.

    \item Three main tools are used for describing the physics
        of nuclear materials:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Analytical models.
            \item Simulations.
            \item Experiments.
        \end{itemize}
    \item All of which have strengths and weaknesses.

    \item The work presented in the thesis is mostly based on
        analytical methods for describing the physical
        processes governing the multiplication and detection
        of neutrons and gamma rays. The results have often
        been compared to simulations, and experiments in form
        of measurements have also been performed to gain
        additional insight.
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}


\begin{slide}[toc=]{Potential Perils?}
The motivation of the work is the double-edged sword that nuclear
materials presents: It is a way to provide carbon emission-free
energy, while at the same time producing waste which needs careful
management.

\begin{slide}[toc=]{The Task}
\vspace{6mm}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The subject of the thesis is the non-intrusive investigation of nuclear materials. \\[6mm]

    \item Detection, identification and quantification of
        nuclear materials from the properties of the detected
        radiation.
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\section[slide=false]{Number Distributions}

\begin{slide}{Branching Processes and Fissile Material}
In fissile material the life of neutrons is a branching process in
which neutrons can generate additional neutrons and reactions.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Correlated events.
    \item Microscopic physics generating macroscopic effects.
\end{itemize} \vspace{-3mm}

\end{slide}


\begin{slide}{Probability Distributions}
\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Neutrons in a fissile sample can undergo a number of
    different processes.
\begin{itemize}
\item Fission.

\item Capture.

\item $(n,x n)$-reactions.

 \item Escape the sample.
\end{itemize}
\item Using the associated reaction probabilities, which depend on
    sample characteristics, probability balance equations can be
    formulated.

\item Generating functions and master equations then provide the
    tools needed to describe the behaviour of particles in the
    sample.

\item The goal: the probability $p(n)$ of generating $n$
    particles when starting with a single particle or a source
    event such as spontaneous fission with the emission of
    several neutrons.
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}


\begin{wideslide}[toc=]{The Theory}
\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{equation} p_1(n)=(1-\mathrm{p})\delta_{n,1} +
\mathrm{p} \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} p_i(k)
\begin{array}{c}  \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \sum \quad \quad \quad  \prod^k_{i=1} p_1(n_i) \cr
\{n_1+n_2+ \ldots + n_k=n\} \quad \quad \quad  \end{array}.
\end{equation}
converted using generating functions to simple master equations:
\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:hz}
h(z)&=&(1-\mathrm{p})z+ \mathrm{p} q_i[h(z)], \\
H(z)&=&q_{sf}[h(z)].
\end{eqnarray}
giving probability terms such as: \vspace{-2mm}
\begin{equation}
 P(2)= \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{1-p}{1-p\overline{\nu_f}}\right)^{2}
 \left[ \overline{\nu_s(\nu_s-1)} +
 \frac{p}{1-p\overline{\nu_f}} \overline{\nu_s} \overline{\nu_f(\nu_f-1)}\right].
\end{equation}\vspace{-2mm}
through:\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:probp} p_1(n) = \left.\frac{1}{n!}
\frac{d^{n}h(z)}{dz^{n}} \right|_{z=0} \quad \mbox{and} \quad P(n)
= \left.\frac{1}{n!} \frac{d^{n}H(z)}{dz^{n}} \right|_{z=0}.

\item Excellent agreement with MCNP-PoliMi.

%\item Model was extended also to include absorption and detection.
\end{itemize}}

\begin{slide}{Gamma Rays}
Gamma rays have no self multiplication, instead they are
    generated as a by-product of the branching process of
    neutrons.

    detection.

\section[slide=false]{Multiplicity Theory}

\begin{slide}{Multiplicity Counting}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Neutron multiplicity counting is used extensively
        for materials control and accountability (MC\&A). \\[2mm]
    \item The system has four parameters: neutron leakage
        multiplication, alpha ratio, fission rate and neutron
        detection efficiency.  \\[2mm]
    \item Three multiplicity rates are normally measured:
        singles, doubles and triples. \\[2mm]
    \item The systems are usually based on $^{3}$He-detectors,
        which are sensitive to slow neutrons. \\[2mm]
    \item The analysis is based on the same type of master
        equations previously mentioned. \\[2mm]
    \item Use of scintillation detectors opens of
        possibilities of detecting not only neutrons.
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}


\begin{slide}{Extensions and Neural Networks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The formalism was extended to take into account not
        only gamma rays, but also mixed particle multiples
        such as $nn\gamma$, $n\gamma$. \\[2mm]
    \item The generation of neutrons and gamma rays shows
        interdependence. \\[2mm]
    \item The analysis grows more and more complicated which
        motivated the usage of artificial neural networks for inverting the solutions (unfolding). \\[2mm]
    \item Parameter unfolding using the information in an
        over-determined system. \\[2mm]

\begin{slide}{Neutron Scattering}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The light pulses generated in a scintillation
        detector by fast neutrons, depend on the scattering
        history. \\[2mm]
    \item Energy is transferred in the collisions and
        transformed into light depending on the nuclei
        involved in the scattering. \\[2mm]
    \item The order and type of nuclei are very important to
        the generated light pulse. \\[6mm]

        therefore a good indicator of fissile material.
    \item Correlation measurements could also give additional

        the inherent speed of the gamma rays and neutrons. \\[1mm]

    \item Simple physical processes such as neutron scattering
        gives very complex analyzes and behaviours in for
        example scintillation detectors. \\[5mm]
